# DuckDnsDUC
A simple DUC for DuckDNS on .Net Framework 4.8

# Description
This application is a simple updater for the Duck DNS service. It is a desktop application that runs in the system tray and reports the current IP address to the Duck DNS service via HTTP. The application needs to be configured at least once, requiring the registered Duck DNS domain name and token. You can then choose additional options like "minimize to tray," "close to tray," or set the update interval. Lastly, you must select one of the network adapters from the dropdown, as the application will use the selected adapterâ€™s IPv4 address to report to Duck DNS.
